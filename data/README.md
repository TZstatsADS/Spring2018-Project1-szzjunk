# Project: 
### Data folder

The data directory contains inaugural data and S&P 500 historial data I used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.
